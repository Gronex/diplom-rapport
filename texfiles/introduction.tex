Comapnies that rely on selling to other companies generaly need a way to keep track of
what customers they have, and which customers they can potentially have in the future.
One way to keep track of such information is via a Customer Relation Management system,
or CRM for short. The aim of such a system is to allow a user to keep track of what
buissiness agreements are curently active, as well as what could be if all goes as planned.
It can also allow the user to keep track of who to contact under a customer, in case it is
a company, or organisation.

Such a system could be run locally, but that reduces its usability, in that it will
be only a single person in the company, or a single machine that will be able to keep
track of the given information. Because of this a CRM is often run as a webserver, either
on the local network of the company, or on the internet, so that it can be accessed
from anywhere, which can be useful if the company has multiple departments, and if the
user wants to access it from a phone, or some other device that may not be connected
directly to the network.
