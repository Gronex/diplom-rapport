\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:Requirements}
In order for me to know what is expected of the system I have spoken with Kristian, and together we have come up with some requirements for the system. This includes what users should be in the system, as well as what those users can do. We also talked about some of the views that are important to have for the CRM to be usable, and what annoys him in the existing CRM's, so that this one will be more to IT-minds needs.

\subsection{Users}

    \item Defines what groups the user is in
  \end{itemize}
  \item Administrator
  \item Standard user
\end{enumerate}
