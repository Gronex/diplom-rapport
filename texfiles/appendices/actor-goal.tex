\chapter{Actor goal table}
\label{app:actor-goal}
The table here has been used to figure out what use cases the system should support, and the final use case diagram can be seen on Figure~\ref{fig:usecase}.

Because of the way the user hierarchy is set up I have not duplicated the goal of the lower actors in the higher ranking ones, as they are all the same.

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    Actor & Goal \\ \hline
    \multirow{10}{*}{User}
    & Create opportunity \\
    & Edit opportunity \\
    & Create Person \\
    & Update person \\
    & Create activity \\
    & Assign activity \\
    & Comment \\
    & Manage personal view settings \\
    & Create company \\
    & Edit company \\
    \hline
    \multirow{14}{*}{Super administrator}
    & Add user \\
    & Edit user \\
    & Delete user \\
    & Set user roles \\
    & Create user group \\
    & Set user groups \\
    & Create activity category \\
    & Update activity category value \\
    & Create opportunity stage \\
    & Update opportunity stage value \\
    & Create opportunity category \\
    & Update opportunity category value \\

  \end{tabular}
